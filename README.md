**Crime Category Prediction Challenge**

In this project, I tackled the complex problem of predicting crime categories using a detailed dataset of crime incidents. The project involved several key steps:

- **Data Preprocessing**: Handled missing values, encoded categorical features, and normalized numerical data to prepare the dataset for modeling.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Uncovered patterns and trends within the dataset, such as temporal patterns and geographical distributions.
- **Feature Engineering**: Created new features to capture significant aspects of the data, including time-based features and encoded categorical variables.
- **Model Training and Optimization**: Employed various machine learning models including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM. Used grid search and cross-validation to optimize model performance.
- **Evaluation**: Achieved a notable accuracy of 95.7% on the test set, demonstrating the effectiveness of the feature engineering and model selection processes.
- **Tools and Libraries**: Utilized Scikit-Learn for model implementation, Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation, and Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization.
